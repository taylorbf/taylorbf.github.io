I work in the field of [experimental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_music) and [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_music). Since 2003, I have created music projects in a variety of modes including internet-based, site-specific, networked, and algorithmic. I currently live in Easthampton, Massachusetts.

From 2007-2017, I researched the use of the internet as an instrument for making music. These investigations included the internet as a site for sound installation; the web browser as a performance instrument; and compositions using networks. I began by making some installations .... [The Last Cloud]() ...  This work evolved into participation in the Web Audio community, including the development of [NexusUI]() and helping to organize the [2nd Web Audio Conference]() as music & arts co-chair. Other projects include Tune.js, Gendy.js. 

Audience participation
   - [IRCAM perf]()
   - [NIME workshop]()
   - Wondergarden grant

Began making site-specific performances...   Sunrise, Racquetball....
Attendance at [Mills College](). In addition to working with the internet and networks, ... new musical Instruments
   - tonebox?
   - Understanding that an instrument frames the boundaries of what can be created. (Much like a score.)
   - [EMMI performance]()

Currently, I am working on ....
   - composing in just intonation, spectral work,
   - algorithmic music.

In addition to my creative work, I worked as a designer & developer for several companies and startups including [ReDigi](), a now-defunct – and somewhat infamous – startup selling used digital music. You can read about their [many court cases](). From 2011-2017 I taught at [Goucher College Digital Arts]() as an adjunct professor, teaching graduate coursese in creative code, new media art, and web development.

Ben Taylor is an interdisciplinary artist and creative coder who specializes in web audio and networked performance practices. His research investigates the way ideas translate between the arts, and how we can apply that history to guide the artistic use of networks. He is the primary author of [NexusUI](http://nexus-js.github.io/ui/), an open-source toolkit for controlling audio in the browser.

Ben has presented his research internationally at conferences and festivals including the Pixilerations New Media Festival (Brown/RISD, 2011), New Interfaces for Musical Expression (Seoul 2013, London 2014), Web Audio Conference (IRCAM/Mozilla 2015), Leaders in Software and Art (NY 2011), Music for People and Thingamajigs (2010), International Conference on Live Coding (McMaster Univ, 2016), International Computer Music Conference (2015), and others. His music has been released by the Society for Electroacoustic Music in the United States (SEAMUS). In 2017 he received a grant from Easthampton City Arts to organize electroacoustic music performances in Western Massachusetts.

He received an M.F.A. In Electronic Music &amp; Recording Media from Mills College and has studied with members of the League of Automatic Music Composers and The Hub, Brian Harnetty, and Pauline Oliveros. Prior to Mills, he received a B.A. in Music (Honors) from Kenyon College in rural Ohio. In 2016, he earned a Ph.D. in Experimental Music & Digital Media from LSU, while doing research at the LSU Center for Computation and Technology.

#### Activities
