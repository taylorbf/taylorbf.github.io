## Bio

Ben Taylor is an interdisciplinary artist and creative coder who specializes in web audio and networked performance practices. His research investigates the way ideas translate between the arts, and how we can apply that history to guide the artistic use of networks. He is the primary author of [NexusUI](http://nexus-js.github.io/ui/), an open-source toolkit for controlling audio in the browser.

Ben has presented his research internationally at conferences and festivals including the Pixilerations New Media Festival (Brown/RISD, 2011), New Interfaces for Musical Expression (Seoul 2013, London 2014), Web Audio Conference (IRCAM/Mozilla 2015), Leaders in Software and Art (NY 2011), Music for People and Thingamajigs (2010), International Conference on Live Coding (McMaster Univ, 2016), International Computer Music Conference (2015), and others. His music has been released by the Society for Electroacoustic Music in the United States (SEAMUS). In 2017 he received a grant from Easthampton City Arts to organize electroacoustic music performances in Western Massachusetts.

He received an M.F.A. In Electronic Music &amp; Recording Media from Mills College and has studied with members of the League of Automatic Music Composers and The Hub, Brian Harnetty, and Pauline Oliveros. Prior to Mills, he received a B.A. in Music (Honors) from Kenyon College in rural Ohio.
