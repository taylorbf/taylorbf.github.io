I needed a project for my Master's thesis at Dartmouth, and I also wanted to pick up some coding skills that I could then tout in the coming job search. When I created b&p in 1998 - 1999, the web, and audio on the web, was still very young and there was plenty of uncharted territory. The dotcom boom was also in full swing and I wanted to move out to the Bay Area and join the excitement. For b&p, I both learned a useful programming language (that would later become my professional skill) - Perl - and I created a piece of sound art that did something new with the web that, to my knowledge, hadn't been done yet. I wanted to create a piece that created a bit of an audio snapshot of the web at the time by searching for sound files. I tried to make it very general in its searches, so that it didn't look for particular types of sounds or music but rather just 'sound file' or 'music aiff', etc. What resulted was a piece that has run for over ten years now, and as search engines have come and gone and as the nature of sound on the web has changed dramatically, so has the output of bits & pieces. One thing that did change in the first couple of years, that speaks to the changing nature of audio on the web, is that b&p originally streamed the RealAudio format because streaming mp3 was not yet as common. As soon as it became the standard, I abandoned RealAudio for mp3."
									},
									{ 	"question": "Did you have an initial concept for the piece that was different than how it turned out? I know these often pieces morph in the making...",
										"answer": "I may have, but it was over ten years ago so I don't really remember. I have always felt that b&p turned out pretty much as I had envisioned, and in that sense, I've always been very happy with the piece."
									},
									{ 	"question": "Is it correct that it is a Python script?",
										"answer": "It's actually all Perl CGI scripts, and fairly amateur ones at that. I did rewrite some it after a year or two, but it was some of the first Perl coding I had done, and as I went on to code Perl professionally for five years after I left Dartmouth, my skills improved dramatically after b&p (and yet the work I did on it, and the concept itself, were the foot in the door that got me my first job out of grad school)."
									},
									{ 	"question": "Do you look at a lot of other web art?",
										"answer": "Not as much as I used to - partly because I've been so busy with my dissertation and with other types of network-based pieces. I think that strictly web-based art, while still out being created and funded from time to time, seems to have fallen a bit out of favor as artists have moved into playing more along the intersections of online and physical space. This would seem a a natural progression given the explosion in mobile devices, the pervasiveness of wireless networks, and so forth. I also think that the initial excitement over all the narrative and multimedia possibilities that the web offered has died down and it has become just another medium (albeit, still one with enormous potential) in the toolbox that technology-focused artists can draw from."
									},
									{ 	"question": "If so, does it move you emotionally?",
										"answer": "Sure it does, just like any art. It just depends on the piece, doesn't it?"
									},
									{ 	"question": "If so, favorite sites?",
										"answer": "Rather than direct you to specific pieces, I would just send you to http://www.turbulence.org, which has been commissioning net art since the 90s (including my 2007 piece, 'ItSpace'), and http://www.rhizome.org, which is probably the largest online catalog and archive of web art, with pieces dating back to the early days."
									},
									{ 	"question": "Does the macro time-structure of the piece matter to you? For example, an emerging trend in dance now is to perform a site-specific piece at the same time every day for several weeks, to see how the site changes. Bits&Pieces has occurred once a day for over a decade now, so I'm wondering if you consider that overall structure to be important to the piece or just a side effect of the way it works.",
										"answer": "Yes, definitely, although perhaps not as much with b&p. I did think of b&p in a way that I thought of Cage's 'Imaginary Landscape No. 4' for twelve radios. Depending on when/where that piece was performed, the content could vary completely, and if it is performed now, it certainly sounds very different from when it was first performed in the early 1950s. I would correct you a little with regards to b&p occurring once-a-day: it actually occurs every fifteen minutes, but it only tries to gather new samples once-a-day. Still, the way the routines are set up, it could do the same search every day and come up with the same links, but still get very different sets of sounds as it progresses through the link results randomly to maximize the number of sounds it finds over time. But like Cage's piece and other site/time specific works, b&p does sound quite different now than it did back in 1999. A few years after it's launch I also added the capability for it to download mp3s as part of its sound samples (in addition to WAV and AIFF format files), and that added a whole other range of sounds for it to work with - and arguably a bit different from wav/aiff as people tend to use mp3 for longer recordings, as opposed to just a sampled guitar riff or line from a movie.<br><br>My recent 2009 piece, 'Solera' addresses your above question much more directly, as it is a 24-hour-a-day physical installation that accumulates recordings within a space over weeks, playing them back and gradually building a texture from the resonances of the space as well as the daily cycles of activity within it. It ran last year for just under three weeks in the main lobby of the studio art building at UVa, and the sound change over that time was dramatic. I was also interested to see how people would react to the presence of this sound in their public space day in and day out for a few weeks. There were a few articles written about it, and you can read about it at the following links:<br><br>http://www.c-ville.com/index.php?cat=11801003094014031&ShowArticle_ID=11800211093429550<br><br>http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=10118<br><br>and on my website, where you can see more photos at: http://www.petertraub.net/installations/"
									},
									{ 	"question": "Lastly, many composers think of their practice in terms of a metaphor with another action: Feldman and Keith Rowe both said they were painting; some of Cage's later work deals with sound sculptures in time; Xenakis often spoke of his pieces in terms of architecture. Do you consider yourself to be doing anything other than writing music? (This isn't meant to be a leading question - no is fine, I'm just curious).",
										"answer": "That's an interesting question - the answer to which depends a lot on what I'm working on at the time. For the past year I've been working all these pieces that are spatially-centric, in that they explore different ways of composing and composing for space - physical, virtual, hybrid, etc. It's the subject of my dissertation so I've been thinking a lot about architecture, resonance, distance, and so on. I've also spent many hours in the metal shop at UVa, learning to weld, cut, and shape steel - all for use in a recent piece I did for dancers, 'Study No. 1 for Bodies, Metal, and Air' in which they used these shaped pieces to interact with controlled microphone feedback, essentially altering the acoustic of the space (you can read about it and watch video of one of the performances here: http://www.petertraub.net/2010/03/13/study-no-1-for-bodies-metal-and-air-premieres/ ). Through this process, I've come to think of myself as a bit of a novice sculptor, and while this becomes yet another tool that I can turn to for making interesting work, it has also affected the way I think about the other work that I'm doing. When making the steel pieces, for example, I was thinking about radiating sound waves, smooth curves, room corners, and so forth, and that all played into how I thought about the rest of the piece (and definitely worked into how the choreography was arranged). When I put all these things together, I'm not sure if I can just call it music, or if it's really more the creation of an environment, but one in which sound/music is the principal environmental condition."

									{ 	"question": "What main concepts motivate your work?",
										"answer": "Right now I am thinking about consciousness and rationalization as technique or technology, embodiment and imagining a systems or emergent approach to work (and being) that considers continuum or circularity in thought and action.  I would say broadly I am interested in the technology of consciousness in the posthuman sense.  If we think our ourselves as an end point, then we become an end.  We have to consider our place in a finite system of life, we see the impact of our selfishness (we work toward this view).  We are moving to a conjunction of science and religion in a kind of inter-being.<br><br>I like emergent complexity, it is interesting to read this and think about Duchamp and Cage playing chess.  It is exciting to go back and think about the work in the past here-<br><br>'Rules, or laws, have no causal efficacy; they do not in fact \'generate\' anything. They serve merely to describe regularities and consistent relationships in nature. These patterns may be very illuminating and important, but the underlying causal agencies must be separately specified (though often they are not). But that aside, the game of chess illustrates precisely why any laws or rules of emergence and evolution are insufficient. Even in a chess game, you cannot use the rules to predict \'history\' - i.e., the course of any given game. Indeed, you cannot even reliably predict the next move in a chess game.<br><br>'Why? Because the \'system\' involves more than the rules of the game. It also includes the players and their unfolding, moment-by-moment decisions among a very large number of available options at each choice point. The game of chess is inescapably historical, even though it is also constrained and shaped by a set of rules, not to mention the laws of physics. Moreover, and this is a key point, the game of chess is also shaped by teleonomic, cybernetic, feedback-driven influences. It is not simply a self-ordered process; it involves an organized, \'purposeful\' activity.'1<br>P.

I am informed by the glitch.  You mention value.  I think it is an interesting question to talk about worth or value and there are a lot of views from there.  This question is more about the frame.  The frame is the value.<br><br>People might think my belief in this is weird though:<br>In the very distant past, a cataclysmic event occurred, which introduced transgenic material into life on Earth.

I am there working through both and I like it when they surprise me so I can look with open eyes and hear with open ears as well.

This produces an audio-visual glitch based on how I change the connections (typical circuit bending).  You can see this here- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEjnKIQt9ik  I then built a simple button controller.<br><br>For the live performance I am using Pure Data and Gem to process the sound and image with effects.  I use frequency and blob detection to create influence between the video and audio.  There is a time-based sequence for the effects and the beats.  The beats use simple synth technique mostly with square waves.  Both the video game glitch and the computational segment are built upon the behavior of electrons, which all seems analogous to the posthuman.  The question of analog and digital is irrelevant to me as most of my work is real-time. "

I like the idea of rubbing or smearing a material on pressed wood fiber (drawing).

The way musical theory is taught tends to be fairly descriptive/analytical of what has been done in the past.  However, more and more, I don't make a distinction between these and other modalities.  My ear, my analytical mind, my memory of prior musical ideas, my muscle memory, and more are all elements of the larger 'me' that I bring to music making.
